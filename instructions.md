   TASKS
   🔁 Payment Gateway Integration
   API Documentation:
   Refer to this document:
   📄 Payment API Docs
   Integration Flow:
   ● Implement a POST /create-payment route.
   ● Accept payment details from the user.
   ● Forward data to the payment API using create-collect-request
   ● Generate JWT-signed payloads as required.
   ● Redirect the user to the payment page from the API response.
   ● hint: read document carefully and implement create-collect-request/ create transaction and
   redirect user to payment page(link will be in response of API) , use jsonwebtoken of sign

    school_id : 65b0e6293e9f76a9694d84b4
   🌐 Webhook Integration
   Create a POST route to update transactions details in DB with the given payload
   Endpoint:
   POST /webhook
   Payload Format:
   {
   "status": 200,
   "order_info": {
   "order_id": "collect_id/transaction_id",
   "order_amount": 2000,
   "transaction_amount": 2200,
   "gateway": "PhonePe",
   "bank_reference": "YESBNK222",
   "status": "success",
   "payment_mode": "upi",
   "payemnt_details": "success@ybl",
   "Payment_message": "payment success",
   "payment_time": "2025-04-23T08:14:21.945+00:00",
   "error_message": "NA"
   }
   Actions:
   ● Parse the webhook payload.
   ● Update the corresponding Order Status entry in MongoDB.
   Tip: Use Postman to simulate webhook calls.

   📄 API Endpoints

1. Fetch All Transactions
   ● GET /transactions
   ● Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline to combine order and order_status schemas.
   ● Fields to return:
   ○ collect_id
   ○ school_id
   ○ gateway
   ○ order_amount
   ○ transaction_amount
   ○ status
   ○ custom_order_id
   Note: Populate dummy data in both schemas for testing.
   this API will return data by combining to schemas order and order status use mongodb
   pipeline to join these two schemas

1. Fetch Transactions by School
   ● GET /transactions/school/:schoolId
   ● Returns all transactions related to a specific school.

1. Check Transaction Status
   ● GET /transaction-status/:custom_order_id
   ● Returns the current status of the transaction.

   ✅ Additional Notes
   ● Data Validation & Error Handling
   Ensure proper validation of all incoming data using validation libraries (e.g., class-validator for
   NestJS). Implement consistent and informative error responses across all endpoints.
   ● Environment Configuration
   Use .env files and the ConfigModule in NestJS (or similar) to manage environment variables.
   This includes sensitive keys like:
   ○ MongoDB Atlas connection string
   ○ Payment API credentials (API key, PG key)
   ○ JWT secret and expiry time

   ● README & Documentation
   Include a comprehensive README.md file with:
   ○ Setup and installation instructions
   ○ API usage examples
   ○ Environment variable configuration
   ○ Postman collection for testing
   ● Scalability & Performance
   ○ Pagination: Implement pagination for all list endpoints (e.g., /transactions) using limit
   and page query parameters.
   ○ Sorting: Support sorting by fields such as payment_time, status, or transaction_amount
   via query parameters (e.g., sort=payment_time&order=desc).
   ○ Indexing: Ensure important fields like school_id, custom_order_id, and collect_id are
   indexed in MongoDB to speed up queries.
   ● Security Best Practices
   ○ Use JWT Authentication for all protected routes.
   ○ Sanitize and validate incoming requests to prevent injection attacks.
   ○ Use HTTPS in production and set appropriate CORS policies.
   ● Robust Logging
   ○ Log incoming webhook events and failed transactions for audit and debugging.

   PART 2- FRONTEND
   Objective:
   Develop a responsive and user-friendly interface for the School Payments and Dashboard
   application. The focus is on creating a React-based frontend that integrates with the backend
   APIs to display and manage data dynamically.
   Requirements
   
1. Project Setup
    Use React.js
    Set up a new project using Vite or Create React App.
    Style the application with Tailwind CSS or any CSS framework of your choice (e.g.,
   Material-UI, Bootstrap).
    Use Axios for API calls and React Router for navigation.
1. Core Features
   a) Dashboard Pages
1. Transactions Overview
   o Display a paginated and searchable list of all transactions fetched from the
   /transactions API.
   o Columns:
    collect_id
    school_id
    gateway
    order_amount
    transaction_amount
    status
    custom_order_id
   o Include a filter dropdown for status (e.g., "Success", "Pending", "Failed").
   o Multi-select filters for status and school IDs. And date-wise transactions
   o Column sorting (asc/desc).
   o Persist filters in URL so users can share specific views or reload without losing
   filter states.
1. Transaction Details by School
   o Create a page that fetches and displays transactions for a specific school_id.
   o Provide a dropdown or search bar to select a school_id.
1. Transaction Status Check
   o A dedicated page or modal where users can input custom_order_id and retrieve
   the current status of a transaction using the check-status API.
1. Optional Features (Extra Credit)
   a) Real-time Data Visualization
   b) Dark Mode
    Implement a toggle for light/dark themes.
   Additional Requirements
